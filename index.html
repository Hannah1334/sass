</div>

<div id="tab1">
<h1>Appearance</h1>
<b>Hair</b><br>
Long natural blonde locks that twist and curl to brush against the lower edges of her shoulder-blades. Her hair is usually parted to the side, sending her bangs sweeping diagnally across her forehead and face.<br>
<b>Eyes</b><br>
Crystal clear blue, like the sky on a bright cloudless day. Her pupils are cat-like slits that almost cut her bright irises in half. They're described as "wide and innocent" even for a young adult, and are almost childlike in nature. Don't let her wide gentle eyes fool you.<br>
<b>Facial</b><br>
Her face is a slender oval shape with high cheekbones, almost innocent and angelic in nature. Her nose is small and "cute," sitting in the center of her face between her ears. Speaking of, her ears are usually well-hidden under all that blonde hair, but sometimes peek out of hiding. The upper tips come together in a barely notable elvish point that would take mentioning to notice. Her mouth is small at first glance, decorated with thin gentle lips. However, should you catch her yawning, you'd find her jaws open very wide and reveal a set of tough white teeth that look pretty close to human, save the overly pointy canines. No, she is not a vampire, but she has been mistaken for one before.<br>
<b>Complexion</b><br>
Sass is covered in a soft layer of peachy skin that has the typical "blonde white girl" look and feel to it. She doesn't burn though, she tans. Pretty easily, actually.<br>
<b>Body Type</b><br>
While standing only at five feet and six inches exactly, Sass weighs roughly around one-hundred-thirty pounds. She is by no means overweight, she happens to be very slim but also very curvy. I mean, very. That bust and ass though, jeez. Anyway, she also has a hard layer of muscle under her soft skin, and we all know muscle weighs more than fat. She's agile and flexible, making running, jumping, punching, and high kicking easier accomplishments.
<h1>Personality</h1>
Her exterior personality consists of crude humor and the seemingly complete lack of care for anyone else. She's selfish, sassy, and won't restrain herself for the comfort of others. Those who break through her exterior find a loyal and caring woman with quite a warm heart.
</div>

<div id="tab2">
<h1>Racial Abilities</h1>
<b>Word of Mouth</b><br>Talking smack slightly increases the overall attack strength of Jinx's mana. If the victim reacts to her words in any way the overall defense capabilities of her mana slightly increase. <br>
<b>Stunted Growth</b><br>
The Faeries are "born" into one single physical age and remain that age eternally. They can die from anything except natural causes. Since Jinx is a half-fae, it takes her ten full human years to age a single year.<br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
The Fae-kind are very sensitive to auras and mana, allowing them to feel or see when another being is drawing from their mana pool or activating their mana in general. <br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
The body of the Fae-kind is light, petite, and athletic. They can move double the speed of the average human and the strongest Fae's speeds can rival that of a hummingbird's. <br>
<b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
Their bodies are as flexible as they are light, allowing them to contort their shapes into absurd formations. Something someone would expect to see in a circus act. <br>
<b>Burning Calories</b><br>
The Fae-kind eat thousands upon thousands of calories on purpose and burn them off very quickly. Physical sugary foods is said to help their mental and magic stability, often allowing them slightly faster mana regeneration than what is average if consumed when their mana-pool is either completely drained or close to it. <br>
<b>Hidden Wings</b><br>
Tribal-like wing markings cover the backs of the Fae-kind. These tribal markings can grow into actual wings and revert back to markings when mana is used.

<div id="tab3">
<h1>History & Lore</h1>
Faeries born from dreams; dreams of the humans in the Realms Beyond. While humans were not very powerful in the supernatural world, their hopes and fantasies had so much power that eventually all new supernatural beings were born just from the collection of human desire. These beings were called Faeries and had a home all their own in a dimension separate from all the rest. One of these Faeries was named Oberon and he became so powerful that the rest of his kind agreed he should be their king. In the minds that birthed him, he was a strong and noble man as well as a wise leader. He reminded them of summer and warmth.
<br><br>
During his reign the Faerie realms were not very well known, so it was like unearthing treasure when the angelics and demonics discovered its existance. They went to war, forcing the Fae to fight one another so they could decide who would control these lands. In the end, the demonics won and the Fae-kind were enslaved. When it was clear that victory was far from their grasp, the Fae sent their king into the human world to hide. The mission was successful and there he waits until he can return and retake his homeland.
<br><br>
While he hid among the humans he had relations with quite a few, which was how Morgan came to be born. Her mother, a very short sassy black woman, refused her to have any contact with her father when he refused to pay child support. Morgan is aware of his identity, but was pretty much raised to hate him.
<br><br>
Convinced by her mother to do something right by the world, "Jinx" started training in track, boxing, karate, until she mastered hand to hand combat. Now she roams the world as a mercenary with thin morals.

<div id="tab4">
<h1>Ritualism</h1>
<i>"Magic which recreates several forms of magic by imbuing Words of Power with Mana in the form of inscribed runic symbols. A mage of this tree may harness any tree of magic, but only in its lesser forms. The mechanics of these runes can vary, from scraps of paper laced with firebombs, to light armors able to project aura temporarily, allowing for a high level of flexibility."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Face Fucker!</b><br>
A rune that, when activated, causes the force of whatever it is placed on to increase two times over.<br>
<b>Machine GUNS!</b><br>
This rune, once activated, increases the top speed an object is already moving two times over. (Cannot achieve speeds over 120 MPH)<br>
<b>Shove!</b><br>
This spell causes the rune to pulsate a wall of force fifteen feet in distance and width. It is capable of knocking over the average humanoid (beings/creatures twice as strong as the average human).<br>
<b>My Nigga</b><br>
Basically the opposite of <b>Shove!</b>, this rune when activated will send a pulse of pure magical force, forcing things not strong enough to withstand <b>Shove!</b> into its center. Cannot access things over fifteen feet away.<br>
<b>BBQ'd Ribs</b><br>
When this rune is activated, it must be laying still. The slightest pressure or movement on it causes it to erupt into a small controlled explosion, setting anything within eight feet on fire.<br>
<b>Sucka!</b><br>
Has to be placed on <i>solid ground</i> to work. It turns the solid ground into a small quicksand trap once activated. (About 5 by 4 feet.)<br>
<b>Taze-a-Bitch</b><br>
This rune, when activated, will safely send an electric pulse through her body into whatever her body is in contact with, effectively protecting her from getting harmed by her own spell.<br>
<b>BackHand</b><br>
If outside pressure is placed on this rune when it's activated (i.e. someone steps on it) then a shovel like construct is conjured and rises up from the ground to smack a nigga right in the head, whether that be the back of their head or their face.<br>
<b>Balloons</b><br>
The terminal velocity of whatever this rune is placed on is cut to to the same terminal velocity of an oxygen filled storebought balloon. Only works when activated.<br>
<b>Block</b><br>
Half of this rune is tattoo'd on the back of her right wrist, and the other half on the back of her left. When she touches the sides of her wrists together and completes the rune (when she bends her elbows and uses her forearms to block attacks) she can activate the rune which causes a wall of mana to act as a barrier. Only mages a rank higher than herself can break through this barrier.
</div>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Forcient: Kinetics</h1>
<i>"A Kinetics mage focuses primarily on the forces of movement; the manipulation of kinetic and potential energy are their specialty. However, many mages may find they have gained access to the manipulation of pressure, and other forces outside of gravity and magnetism. A Kinetics mage's magic is very special- while it is magic, their spells often inflict physical damage."</i>
<br><br>
<b>My Name Is Sanic</b><br>
This is a buff that allows her to increase the kinetic energy created and outputted by her legs and feet twice over, allowing her to reach faster speeds on foot.<br>
<b>In Soviet Russia</b><br>
Another buff that allows her to increase the kinetic energy created and outputted by her arms and fists twice over, allowing her arms to reach incredibly speeds without damaging her shoulders and back. (My Name Is Sanic and In Soviet Russia cannot be cast at the same time. Both still cause her to exert the same amount of energy that sprinting and punching normally would so she can't keep it up for long.)<br>
<b>Energy Store</b><br>
Jinx can store up her Kinetic energy much like one charges a spell. Once she lets go of the object she's pushing mana into, it shoots off as though propelled by a slingshot. How far and fast it goes depends on how many turns she takes charging the spell.<br>
<b>Slip n' Slide</b><br>
When this spell is active, she can treat solid surfaces like ice, enabling herself to skate across its surface rather than run.<br>
<b>Good Vibrations</b><br>
Jinx has a spell that allows her whole body to safely vibrate at speeds and intensities dangerous for the average human.
</div>

<div id="tab6">
<h1>Items & Weapons</h1>
<b>Slick</b><br>
Now usually she prefers to fight with her fists, but not all fights can be won like that. Some people are too long range! So Jinx found herself a choice weapon. Upon first glance, the blade named "Slick" just looks like any other two-and-a-half foot broadsword. The only characteristic that hints at its individuality would be the odd line of connected decorative jewels that sit in a perfect line along the center of the blade. Well what happens at the simple flick-of-the-wrist? This motherfucker expands into a whip! The blade extends like puzzle-pieces, held together by a small iron chain that gives Slick the flexibility to extend and re-assemble in one to two swings. What makes this sharp chain-whip of terror so "elastic" in behavior? Easy, there's a spell for that.
<br>
<b>Gloves</b><br>
A pair of fingerless leather black gloves cover her fists and act as fantastic mediums. Used not only to enhance her punches, blocks, and other spells found in that section of this character sheet; these gloves can even help her cast spells so she<br>
can do a bit of long range too!<br>
<b>Boots</b><br>
Jinx's shoes are also mediums, fantastic knee-high thick leather boots designed to fight. In the spell section there'll be some specific abilities that go along very veeeery well for these. The point to make here is that they're durable, flexible, have great traction, and pretty water-proof since they're leather so...hello snow terrains?
